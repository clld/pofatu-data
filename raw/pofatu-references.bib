  abstract = {In 1987 we excavated 11m2 of cultural deposit at the Ureia site (AIT10), Aitutaki, Cook Islands. First discovered and excavated by Peter Bellwood in 1970, the coastal Ureia site is very rich in midden, particularly fish bone and marine molluscs. We identified 13 main stratigraphic layers at Ureia. of which Layers III. V. and VII represent the primary concentrations of cultural materials. Nine radio-carbon dates on charcoal range from 200 ± 50 yr BP (Layer III) to 1040 ± 80 yr BP (Layer VII). Our attempts to date the presumably older strata that underlie Layer VII have been unsuccessful. The Ureia site has yielded bones of two species of birds that no longer occur on Aitutaki: the Sooty Crake (Porzana tabuensis) and an extinct, undescribed species of whistling duck (cf. Dendrocygna).},

Related processes of shoreline progradation and aggradation created near-shore environments conducive to human habitation, directly evidenced by ca. AD 900–1200. Nevertheless, biotic materials associated with this early cultural stratum suggest human colonization prior to this time. Archaeological preservation and recovery also may have been affected by changing sea level and related sedimentary processes.},

  abstract = {East Polynesia was the geographic terminus of prehistoric human expansion across the globe and the southern Cook Islands, the first archipelago west of Samoa, a gateway to this region. Fourteen new radiocarbon dates from one of the oldest human settlements in this archipelago, the Ureia site (AIT-10) on Aitutaki Island, now indicate occupation from cal AD 1225–1430 (1σ), nearly 300 yr later than previously suggested. Although now among the most securely dated central East Polynesian sites, the new age estimate for Ureia places it outside the settlement period of either the long or short chronology models. The new dates have, however, led to a comfortable fit with the Ureia biological evidence, which suggests not a virgin landscape, but a highly a modified fauna and flora. The results also provide the first systematic demonstration of inbuilt age in tropical Pacific trees, a finding that may explain widely divergent 14C results from several early East Polynesian sites and has implications for the dating of both island colonization and subsequent intra-island dispersals.},

  abstract = {Measurements made at the Australian National University using laser ablation ICPMS show that none of the 88 analyzed obsidian artifacts from East Timor match either the known Papua New Guinea or the five Island SE Asian source samples in our ANU collections. There is a coastal journey of more than 3000 km between the occurrence of obsidians from the Bismarck Archipelago volcanic province of Papua New Guinea and the Sunda-Banda Arc volcanic chain, yet obsidian artifacts from the two important PNG sources of Talasea and Lou Island are found at coastal Bukit Tengkorak in eastern Sabah at a similar distance along with material that has no known source. Timor lies south of the eastern section of the active volcanic Banda Arc island chain but it is within range of possible rhyolite sources from there. Although there is a continuous chain of around 60 active volcanoes stretching from west Sumatra to the Moluccas most are basaltic to andesitic with few areas likely to produce high silica dacite–rhyolite deposits. This does not exclude the possibility that the volcanic landscapes may contain obsidian, but without detailed survey and chemical analysis of sources from the Sunda-Banda Arc the attribution of the Timor obsidian artifacts remains to be demonstrated. Timor may seem to be an unlikely source for the presence of obsidians as it lacks reports of the silica-rich rhyolite volcanic centers necessary to produce this material. Despite the absence of detailed survey and analysis of Indonesian obsidian sources, especially from the volcanically active Banda Arc, this paper presents evidence that one of two obsidian sources is clearly from Timor while the other, with less certainty, is also from an unknown local source.},

Faunal and artefactual analyses indicate that the main function of the settlement was open-sea fishing for red cod and barracouta in particular. This is the first specialised fishing site of the Archaic period which has been reported in Otago, and its existence reinforces other evidence of functional variation in the settlement patterns of that time.},

The Lapita cultural complex of Melanesia and western Polynesia, an entity beloved of a generation of Pacific prehistorians and ever a hot source of debate, can now be shown to have retained at least some links with contemporary populations far to the west of its known distribution. This is significant, not least because some scholars identify the immediate source zone for Lapita as having existed somewhere in the islands of Southeast Asia. At the same time, the obsidian quarried by Lapita artisans from Talasea on the Melanesian island of New Britain can be shown to have been among the most far-traded commodities of the Neolithic world.},

It presents a comprehensive synthesis of the author’s three-decade-long research program tracking this settlement through a distinctive type of decorated pottery referred to as Lapita. The impact of the first Polynesians on pristine tropical environments, their subsistence practices as inferred through archaeological data, their material culture and art, the chronology and motivations behind the expansion, and the reflections of this past in the Tongan present are addressed in different chapters. Insights into the individuals, events and decisions influencing such a lengthy research endeavour are integrated throughout.},

  abstract = {The Marquesan island of Eiao was an important source of fine-grained basalt in Central East Polynesia, with examples being identified in archaeological assemblages throughout the region. However, compared to many other large-scale Polynesian basalt sources, little has been published about the physical extent and geochemical variability of tool-quality basalt on Eiao; prior to our study, only a single site with evidence of stone extraction had been identified and geochemi- cal information was limited to less than two dozen samples. In this paper we report geochemical data for 225 additional basalt specimens collected on Eiao. Our analyses were conducted non-destructively using three EDXRF instruments: one lab-based unit and two portable analysers. The majority of our sample, identified here as Group 1, possesses geochemical and physical characteristics similar to those reported in previous studies. Group 1 samples were collected from various locations on Eiao suggesting that, rather than being limited to a single quarry site, fine-grained basalt was extracted from multiple sources throughout the island. In addition, we identified a second group (Group 2), which possesses a distinct geochemistry, a coarser grain and often an unusual reddish colour. Evidence from Eiao indicates that Group 2 stone was regularly utilised and our analysis of an adze collected on Hiva Oa Island suggests that this material was distributed at least as far as the southern Marquesas.},

This paper presents the results of a study to determine whether the obsidian artifacts found in Gua Pawon, Dago and Bukit Karsamanik in Bandung came from the well-known sources of Gunung Kendan in Nagreg, Kampung Rejeng in Garut or elsewhere. Obsidian artifacts for this study were obtained from earlier archaeological excavations at Gua Pawon and from chance finds at the sites of Dago and Bukit Karsamanik in Bandung. Samples of obsidian were also collected from the known obsidian sources in Gunung Kendan in Nagreg and Kampung Rejeng in Garut for comparative purposes.Analyses of these samples were done on a scanning electron microscope using the energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer at the University of Science Malaysia, Penang and the electron microprobe at the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur. Multi-element analysis was undertaken, and statistical procedures were performed on data obtained from the artifacts and the sources. The results of the study thus far suggested that the obsidian artifacts from Gua Pawon were made using obsidian obtained from both Gunung Kendan and Kampung Rejeng sources while those from Dago and Bukit Karsamanik have yet to be determined. More samples from all the known obsidian sources are needed to determine the variability within and between all the different sources. Temporally, the study also revealed that prehistoric humans at Gua Pawon exploited or used the same obsidian resources over several thousands of years.~Abstrak. Tulisan ini membahas hasil studi tentang sumber bahan baku artefak obsidian yang ditemukan di Gua Pawon, Dago, dan Bukit Karsamanik, Bandung. Analisis dilakukan terhadap sejumlah artefak obsidian, temuan ekskavasi di Gua Pawon dan temuan permukaan di Situs Dago dan Bukit Karsamanik. Untuk perbandingan dilakukan juga analisis terhadap obsidian dari Gunung Kendan di Nagrek dan Kampung Rejeng di Garut, dua lokasi sumber obsidian di Jawa Barat.Analisis dilakukan dengan cara "scanning electron microscope", menggunakan "energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer" di Universitas Sains Malaysia, Penang dan "electron microprobe" di Universitas Malaya, Kuala Lumpur. Analisis multielemen dan perhitungan statistic dilakukan terhadap data yang diperoleh dari artefak dan bahan. Hasil studi memperlihatkan artefak obsidian dari Gua Pawon menggunakan bahan dari Gunung Kendan dan Kampung Rejeng, sementara artefak Dago dan Bukit Karsamanik belum diketahui sumbernya. Analisis terhadap bahan dari sumber-sumber lain sangat diperlukan untuk menentukan variabilitas di dalam dan di antarasumber-sumber yang berbeda. Untuk sementara, hasil studi memperlihatkan manusia prasejarah Gua Pawon mengeksploitasi dan menggunakan sumber-sumber obsidian yang sama selama beberapa ribu tahun.},

The obsidian artifacts used in this study were excavated from the site of Ulilang Bundok while samples of obsidian were also collected from known obsidian sources in Nagcarlan, Batangas, and Pagudpod, Ilocos Norte, for comparative purposes. Chemical analyses of the obsidian artifacts and source samples were carried out on a scanning electron microscope using the energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer at the University of Science Malaysia, Penang and the electron microprobe at the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur. Multielemental analysis and statistical procedures performed on elemental data obtained from the obsidian artifacts and sources provided strong indications that the obsidian artifacts from Ulilang Bundok were made using obsidian obtained from the Nagcarlan source. The chemical sourcing results are significant in that they suggest that obsidian was a limited and valued raw material that was likely mined and traded through expanding social exchange networks. This has further implications for understanding how the complexity and spatial extent of trade reflects emerging social complexity in the Philippines Metal Age.}

The chronological placement of key sites was an essential facet of the research. A secondary goal was to locate sites with ceramic components, particularly sites with Lapita ceramics, and relate the ceramic assemblages typologically and chronologically to those known for Western Samoa. These investigations generated 16 14C dates from archaeological contexts. I present here the previously unpublished 14C data from those samples, and briefly summarize their importance for understanding Samoan prehistory.},

It is rare to see such a comprehensive report on hard data published these days, especially one so insightfully contextualised by the editors' introductory and concluding chapters. These scholars and the others involved in the work really know their stuff, and it shows. The editors connect the preoccupations of Pacific archaeologists with those of their colleagues working in other island regions and on “big questions” of colonisation, migration, interaction and patterns and processes of cultural change in hitherto-uninhabited environments. These sorts of outward-looking, big-picture contextual studies are invaluable, but all too often are missing from locally- and regionally-oriented writing, very much to its detriment. In sum, the work strongly advances our understanding of the early prehistory of Fiji through its well-integrated combination of original research and the reinterpretation of existing knowledge in the context of wider theoretical and historical concerns. In doing so The Early Prehistory of Fiji makes a truly substantial contribution to Pacific and archaeological scholarship. Professor Ian Lilley, The University of Queensland},

  abstract = {Tonga was unique in the prehistoric Pacific for developing a maritime state that integrated the archipelago under a centralized authority and for undertaking long-distance economic and political exchanges in the second millennium A.D. To establish the extent of Tonga’s maritime polity, we geochemically analyzed stone tools excavated from the central places of the ruling paramounts, particularly lithic artifacts associated with stone-faced chiefly tombs. The lithic networks of the Tongan state focused on Samoa and Fiji, with one adze sourced to the Society Islands 2,500 km from Tongatapu. To test the hypothesis that nonlocal lithics were especially valued by Tongan elites and were an important source of political capital, we analyzed prestate lithics from Tongatapu and stone artifacts from Samoa. In the Tongan state, 66\% of worked stone tools were long-distance imports, indicating that interarchipelago connections intensified with the development of the Tongan polity after A.D. 1200. In contrast, stone tools found in Samoa were from local sources, including tools associated with a monumental structure contemporary with the Tongan state. Network analysis of lithics entering the Tongan state and of the distribution of Samoan adzes in the Pacific identified a centralized polity and the products of specialized lithic workshops, respectively. These results indicate that a significant consequence of social complexity was the establishment of new types of specialized sites in distant geographic areas. Specialized sites were loci of long-distance interaction and formed important centers for the transmission of information, people, and materials in prehistoric Oceania.},

Population expansion was accompanied by the introduction of domesticated plants and animals, but the location and content of Lapita deposits frequently suggests that early subsistence focused on the collection of wild resources. The tension between models that advocate Neolithic migration as sustained by agricultural yields and archaeological data that disclose rapid dispersal and a reliance on indigenous resources is particularly acute in the Kingdom of Tonga. Lapita settlements located on the palaeoshoreline of Tongatapu are associated with extensive shell midden deposits suggesting the establishment of permanent settlements that were located in proximity to marine resources before human predation or a declining sea-level fall led to resource collapse and site abandonment. Analysis of a shell midden sample associated with ancient burials from Talasiu on Tongatapu suggests a small sedentary occupation that lasted a few generations \textasciitilde 2700–2650calBP. Site abandonment does not appear to have been caused by a decline in marine yields and identified starch from eight food plants is the first direct evidence for a broad-spectrum mixed economy. While human predation of marine resources was substantial, sea-level fall is likely to have led to the closure of the Fanga 'Uta Lagoon at \textasciitilde 2500calBP resulting in the loss of benthic habitats and the reduction of economically important marine taxa that sustained and structured early sedentism.},

There are multiple obsidian sources located on the island, of which it has been reported that some of it was exploited for use prehistorically. Although there have been basic reports made on these sources in the past, the island has never been subject to in-depth analysis. This thesis presents information pertaining to the differing quality of the obsidian that is present on the island; its abundance, availability and geochemical variation. It then takes the information gained from these analyses and compares it to archaeological obsidians recovered from six prehistoric sites located within the Tamaki Region which showed that the only source that was exploited on Aotea was one which is associated with Te Ahumata, a mountain consisting of mainly rhyolitic sinter. This source was not prevalent in the Tamaki Region during the Archaic phase of occupation but became the dominant source in the later Classic phase, when it became more common than obsidian from Mayor Island, New Zealand‘s most exploited obsidian source.},

Large numbers of adzes at various stages of manufacture through to fully polished form are present. Other artefacts are bone and shell fish hooks, lure shanks, bone needles, a bird spear point, a probable bull roarer, and a seal-tooth pendant. Faunal remains consist of shellfish, marine fish, sea mammals, and birds. The site has a complex stratigraphical history, but radiocarbon dates suggest a relatively brief period of occupation ranging from AD 1400 to 1500.]},

We report a short dating sequence running from 1215 to 1390 CE, which makes the Atiahara site one of the earliest settlements in the Austral Islands. Finally, we mention the potential for tackling important topics in Polynesian archaeology through this key site, including the evolution of material culture and fishing strategies, socio-economic dynamics within a central Polynesian domestic context and possible climate variability in the region.},

  abstract = {Stone tool geochemistry provides hard evidence for post-settlement voyaging and inter-island contacts in East Polynesia. This offers promising information on inter-community exchange networks that are not documented by ethnographic accounts. Drawing on “geochemical fingerprints”, provenance studies have slowly integrated geological data in order to better constrain the origin of archaeological material. However, the occurrence of overlapping geochemical signatures within Polynesian islands can cause difficulties when attempting to differentiate sources. Identifying clear geochemical characteristics for each island is therefore critical for a comprehensive understanding of the interaction patterns in East Polynesian societies. In this paper, we combine major and trace element data with isotopes as well as 40Ar-39Ar ages to constrain the local procurement networks that were occurring on the island of Tupua'i (Austral-Cook chain). We also demonstrate that some Tupua'i archaeological material originated from Eiao Island (Marquesas chain) circa 2000km north. This represents the first hard evidence for inter-island connections between the Austral and the Marquesas Archipelagos.},

  abstract = {Teti'aroa, located 28 nautical miles (52 km) north of Tahiti, lies at the periphery of the Windward Society islands. At the end of the eighteenth century, this atoll was presumably controlled by the chiefdom of Porionu'u, which included the districts of Pare and Arue on the north coast of Tahiti. This situation is confirmed by a number of ethnohistorical accounts and oral traditions describing an intense traffic of basic resources between the atoll and Tahiti island as well as the specific function of Teti'aroa for Tahitian social elites visiting the atoll for ceremonial or recreational purposes. However, the prehistory of the atoll remains largely unknown and the time-depth of dominance by Tahitian elites on the atoll is unclear. In this paper, we investigate potential inter-island relationships between Teti'aroa and other islands in the archipelago and beyond. We present geochemical analyses (energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry) of stone tools and elements of ceremonial architecture (marae), which were necessarily imported given the complete subsidence of the volcanic substratum of the island. Our results confirm the regional origin of a majority of artefacts, but also indicate several later long-distance relationships maintained by Tahitian chiefs.},

  abstract = {Although the peopling of Remote Oceania is well-documented as a general process of eastward migrations from Island Southeast Asia and Near Oceania toward the archipelagos of Remote Oceania, the origin and the development of Polynesian societies in the Western Pacific (Polynesian Outliers), far away from the Polynesian triangle, remain unclear. Here, we present a large-scale geochemical sourcing study of stone artifacts excavated from archeological sites in central Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and the Caroline Islands and provide unambiguous evidence of multiple long-distance voyages, with exotic stone materials being transported up to 2500 kilometers from their source. Our results emphasize high mobility in the Western Pacific during the last millennium CE and offer insights on the scale and timing of contacts between the Polynesian Outliers, their neighbors in the Western Pacific, and societies of Western Polynesia.}

  abstract = {This project presents a material-centered instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) characterization of 120 geologic samples selected from four fine-grained basalt quarries on the Samoan Island of Tutuila. Previous attempts at definitive differentiation of these Tutuilan quarries have utilized x-ray fluorescence (XRF). In this study, clear differentiation of each analyzed quarry was achieved using INAA. Biplots of canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) scores for the INAA data illustrate clear separation based on the variation in chemical composition between each quarry. The samples analyzed not only define quarry separation, but also provide the “core group” for a preliminary baseline necessary for future artifact-centered provenance studies. Inclusion of these “core group” samples in the baseline was confirmed by stepwise discriminant analysis. These findings suggest the ability to determine artifact quarry of origin on the island of Tutuila, which can elucidate the importance of individual Tutuilan quarries in the production, distribution and consumption of fine-grained basalt artifacts in Polynesia.},

  abstract = {In this thesis we develop an approach to using obsidian hydration date (OHD) chronometric data as a chronology building tool. A Bayesian interpretive framework is developed that enables archaeological chronology to be outlined through OHD data. This is implemented both for OHD as a stand-alone dating system, and for OHD in combination with convention radiocarbon age (CRA) chronometric measurements. On the basis of this development we assess the current utility of OHD as a chronology building tool, and evaluate its future potential. The purpose of this research is two-fold.  At a general level the research presented here illustrates how the Bayesian calibration frameworks that have been extensively developed over the past decade (e.g., Naylor and Smith 1988; Buck and Litton 1995; Buck et al. 1991, 1992, 1994a, 1994b, 1994c, 1996; Christen 1994a, 1994b; Christen and Buck 1998; Christen and Litton 1995; Christen et al. 1995; Litton and Buck 1995, 1996; Litton and Leese 1991; Nicholls and Jones 1998, 2001; Zeidler et al.l998) can be extended to incorporate other types of chronometric data - OHD in this case. To-date the implementation of Bayesian calibration frameworks have principally focussed on combining CRA data with non-metric temporal data such as the relative ordering of events implied by super-position. However, while radiocarbon is the most widely used chronometric technique in the world other types of chronometric data are more suited to addressing particular temporal questions than radiocarbon assays. In the example considered in this thesis we identify obsidian hydration dating as having the potential to provide chronometric data that can address questions relating to the fine grained relative timing of events, which is identified as a particular weakness of the radiocarbon chronometric largely due to the non-monotonic nature of the radiocarbon calibration curve.  At a New Zealand specific level the research presented in this thesis seeks to provide an advance in the ability to resolve the type of temporal questions that are central to the understanding of New Zealand's archaeological record. By world standards New Zealand's prehistory is short- potentially spanning only 600 years. Thus the temporal resolution of archaeological investigation is typically high. In this thesis we seek to combine radiocarbon and OHD chronometric data within a suitable statistical framework that leverages the benefits of both techniques, enhancing our ability to explore archaeological chronology in New Zealand.  Thus the research presented in this thesis outlines the development of an approach to chronometric enquiry that is of general interest and in the process make an advance for archaeological enquiry in New Zealand.},

  abstract = {We apply X-ray fluorescence (XRF) geochemical analysis to a collection of 'Opunohu Valley lithic artifacts from Mo'orea island to investigate the local scale of raw material procurement, adze production, use, and exchange within the Society Island archipelago. We use these data to document the distribution of non-local versus local volcanic artifacts in 'Opunohu Valley house sites, ritual sites, and specialized sites, as a means for establishing intra-site production and consumption patterns, and access to exotic, possibly superior, stone resources, and how these two themes correlate with site function or household wealth and status. Overall, 30\% of the artifacts analyzed via WDXRF derive from non-local sources, notably two other islands in the archipelago outside of the political boundaries of Moorean chiefdoms. Our case study thus provides the first direct material evidence of intra-archipelago trade and exchange in the Society Islands. Intra-archipelago trade in adzes was certainly in place by as early as A.D. 1350, if not earlier, and continued up until the time of European contact. In addition, our analyses have identified a local adze production locale in the Afareaitu district of Mo'orea island. The patterns of local versus non-local adze production and exchange strongly suggest that dual interaction spheres were involved. The correlation between adzes and adze-related debris produced from off-island sources and sites with specialized use, which were often reserved for the social, ritual, and political elites in Ma'ohi society suggests that some of the exotic adzes derived from gift exchange between Mo'orea and ruling elites in Tahiti and the Leeward Islands. These adzes from afar would have solidified socio-political and ideological alliances between elites in the Windward and Leeward sectors of the archipelago.},

However, elite control of unevenly distributed resources, such as high-quality volcanic rock for adze production, may have provided an alternative source of economic power. To test this hypothesis we used nondestructive energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) analysis of 328 lithic artifacts from 36 archaeological features in the Kahikinui district, Maui Island, to geochemically characterize the source groups. This process was followed by a limited sampling using destructive wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) analysis to more precisely characterize certain nonlocal source groups. Seventeen geochemical groups were defined, eight of which represent extra-Maui Island sources. Although the majority of stone tools were derived from Maui Island sources (71\%), a significant quantity (27\%) of tools derived from extraisland sources, including the large Mauna Kea quarry on Hawai‘i Island as well as quarries on O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, and Lāna‘i islands. Importantly, tools quarried from extralocal sources are found in the highest frequency in elite residential features and in ritual contexts. These results suggest a significant role for a wealth economy based on the control and distribution of nonagricultural goods and resources during the rise of the Hawaiian archaic states.},

Radiocarbon dates indicate use of the rock shelter from the 13th to the mid-17th centuries, followed by a sterile depositional hiatus, and then final early post-contact use (late 18th to early 19th century). Zooarchaeological analysis of faunal remains indicates rapid declines in local populations of seabirds, especially procellariids, as well as later increases in numbers of the introduced, commensal Pacific rat (Rattus exulans). Macro- and micro-botanical evidence documents transformation of the island's flora from indigenous forest to one dominated by economic plants and fire-resistant taxa. A multi-causal model of dynamic interactions, including nutrient depletion due to seabird loss, most likely accounts for this dramatic ecological transformation.},

  abstract = {Sites which have been occupied semi-continuously in the past present some inherent difficulties for archaeology. Here we present new research from a coastal site on the North Island of New Zealand at Cooks Beach where anthropogenic vegetation changes are seen using microfossil analysis of obsidian tools, sediments and pit fill. The results indicate the initial presence of people in AD 1300–1400 followed by subsequent periods of disuse or abandonment and sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) cultivation. Around the time of initial settlement, obsidian from this location is found at sites across the country. After AD 1400 the area appears to be deserted for a century or more, after which we see evidence for the cultivation of sweet potato in AD 1500 as evidenced by extensive soil modification and numerous storage pits. There is no evidence of a permanent settlement at the site. The geographic distribution of Cooks Beach obsidian was constricted while the site was used for sweet potato cultivation, a pattern often attributed to increased warfare. It appears cultivation was abandoned after AD 1650 marking a second secession of use, a fact confirmed in AD 1769 when Captain Cook visited the area. We consider the possible drivers for the late abandonment of cultivation at Cooks Beach.},

  abstract = {Exchange activities, formal or otherwise, serve a variety of purposes and were prominent in many Pacific Island societies, both during island settlement and in late prehistory. Recent Polynesian studies highlight the role of exchange in the region’s most hierarchical polities where it contributed to wealth economies, emergent leadership, and status rivalry in late prehistory. Building on this research, we hypothesized that exchange in low hierarchy chiefdoms (kin-based polities where there are distinctions between commoners and elites but ranking within the latter is lacking, weak, or ephemeral) would differ in frequency and function from that associated with strongly hierarchical polities. We address this hypothesis through geochemical, morphological, and distributional analyses of stone tools on Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands. Non-destructive Energy-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) and destructive Wavelength-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (WDXRF) analyses of 278 complete and broken tools (adzes, chisels, preforms) from four valleys identify use of stone from at least seven sources on three islands: five on Nuku Hiva and one each on Eiao and Ua Pou. A functional analysis demonstrates that no tool form is limited to a particular source, while inter-valley distributions reveal that the proportions of non-local or extra-valley tools (43 to 94\%, mean = 77\%) approximate or exceed results from other archipelagoes, including those from elite and ritual sites of Polynesian archaic states. Intra-valley patterns also are unexpected, with non-local stone tools being recovered from both elite and commoner residential areas in near-equal proportions. Our findings unambiguously demonstrate the importance of exchange in late prehistoric Marquesan society, at varied social and geographic scales. We propose the observed patterns are the result of elites using non-local tools as political currency, aimed at reinforcing status, cementing client-patron relations, and building extra-valley alliances, consistent with prestige societies elsewhere and early historic accounts from the Marquesan Islands.},

To these ends, a reference dataset for New Zealand obsidians containing over 1500 samples is reported in this paper, previous source assignment methods are reviewed and a selection of multivariate approaches are evaluated.},

The exception to this is the discovery of non-local direct access evident in assemblages from the extreme southern end of Hawai‘i Island; these visits may have involved voyages by canoe. While people did not often travel far for volcanic glass they nonetheless appear to have had unfettered accessed to source material and freely conducted inter-community exchanges.

XRF analysis presented here suggests the site\&rsquo;s builders favoured columnar basalt from the island\&rsquo;s main shield building stage (7-8 mya) over post-shield material. Boulders incorporated in the architecture are primarily from post-shield stage Temwen Island but supplemented by some main shield boulders from mainland Pohnpei. Preliminary findings further suggest that there were shifts in the relative frequency of quarries used to construct different structures. These shifts could relate to exhaustion of accessible stone from specific sources or perhaps changing preferences for stone from different sources due to social or political imperatives.},

Here we use collections of obsidian artefacts that date to a period of endemic warfare among Maori during New Zealand's Late Period (1500–1769 A.D.) to determine what strategies people engaged in to obtain obsidian, namely (1) collecting raw material directly from a natural source, (2) informal trade and exchange, and (3) formal trade and exchange. These deposits represent a good cross-section of Late Period archaeology, including primary working of raw material at a natural source (Helena Bay), undefended sites where people discarded rubbish and worked obsidian (Bream Head), and a heavily fortified site (Mt. Wellington). We find that most of the obsidian described here was likely obtained directly from natural sources, especially those located on off-shore islands within about 60–70 km of sites. A smaller amount comes from blocks of material transported from an off-shore island a greater distance away, called Mayor Island, in a formal trade and exchange network. This study demonstrates the value of conducting tandem lithic technology and geochemical sourcing studies to understand how people create and maintain social networks during periods of warfare.},

  abstract = {Circumscription theory, originally proposed to explain the rise of state society, is appealing in that it gives us an elegant, straightforward way to account for warfare among farming communities in the transition to complex societies. It predicts that as populations increase, groups will come in to conflict over limited prime land, and thus explain why we see a spatial correlation between good farmland and fortifications; as has been noted in New Zealand (Aotearoa). But, to date we do not have strong data to support the notion that conflict between Maori was primarily about access to farmland, and counter to circumscription theory, ethnography suggests exclusive ownership was discouraged. Here we test the efficacy of circumscription for understanding Maori history using obsidian artefact data from Pouerua Pa, a fortification in the heart of Ngā Puhi's tribal territory. New geochemical sourcing clears up ambiguities in source assignments and shows shifts in access to local sources and long distance exchange. We interpret these changes as being consistent with circumscription having been a factor in the earliest stage of fortification construction, and easing over time as the area was largely confederated under a single tribal identity in the early post-contact period.},

We employed geochemical sourcing of basalt used as architectural stone and high-precision uranium-thorium series dates (230Th/U) on coral from the tomb of the first chief of the entire island to identify the beginning of monument building at Nan Madol in AD 1180-1200. Over the next several centuries (AD 1300-1600) monument building began on other islands across Oceania. Future research should be aimed at resolving the causes of these social transformations through higher quality data on monument building.},

Of particular interest are islands classified as Polynesian Outliers, where people speak Polynesian languages and have distinctly Polynesian cultural traits, but are located within the Melanesian or Micronesian cultural areas. While the classification of these groups as Polynesian is not in dispute, the material evidence for the movement between Polynesia and the Polynesian Outliers is exceedingly rare, unconfirmed, and in most cases, nonexistent. We report on the first comprehensive sourcing (using a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) of obsidian and volcanic glass artifacts recovered from excavations on the Polynesian Outlier island of Tikopia. We find evidence for: (1) initial settlement followed by continued voyages between Tikopia and an island Melanesian homeland; (2) long-distance voyaging becoming much less frequent and continuing to decline; and (3) later voyaging from Polynesia marked by imports of volcanic glass from Tonga beginning at 765 cal yr BP (±54 yr). Later long-distance voyages from Polynesia were surprisingly rare, given the strong cultural and linguistic influences of Polynesia, and we suggest, may indicate that Tikopia was targeted by Tongans for political expansion.},

  abstract = {The Mauna Kea Adze Quarry Complex is the largest-known prehistoric quarry in the Pacific Basin. The main extraction areas are located at an extreme altitude (3,800 m), near the summit of Hawaii's tallest mountain. The Mauna Kea summit region and the quarry are considered by many Hawaiians to be a sacred landscape and archaeologists must consider the ethical tensions involved in conducting Western science in these areas. Although provenance studies of basalt adzes are integral to the examination of pre-contact Hawaiian economics, former studies of Hawaiian adze distribution have been limited in scope, and conventionally relied on destructive petrography and petrology for the analyses. Published geochemical data on the quarry are derived from only eight samples analyzed with destructive methods. In order to better define the variation within the quarry, and to develop a more culturally sensitive approach, we employed nondestructive energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) of whole-rock samples to characterize 820 flakes and 47 geological samples from the quarry complex. This study offers the first reliable estimation of the overall range of geochemical variability in the complex. These results suggest that nondestructive EDXRF can be used to differentiate Mauna Kea basalts from other known Hawaiian quarries, but more characterization of other quarries is necessary to confirm exclusive separation of sources. The results further demonstrate that EDXRF is capable of detecting intra-site geochemical variation in Mauna Kea quarry material. ,  Résumé La cantera de azuela en Mauna Kea es la cantera prehistórica más grande en la Cuenca Pacífica. La región principal de extracción se sitúa a una altitud extrema (3800 m), cerca de la cima de la montaña más alta en Hawaii, Mauna Kea. La cima de Mauna Kea y la cantera constituyen un paisaje sagrado de la cultura tradicional de Hawai, y los arqueólogos necesitan considerar los conflictos éticos al trabajar investigaciones científicas en estos sitios. Aunque los estudios sobre el origen de azuela basáltica son integrales para el análisis de la economía precolombina en Hawaii, los estudios precedentes de la distribución de azuelas hawaianas han sido limitados en alcance y, de una manera convencional, han sido basados en la petrología y la petrografía destructiva para sus análisis. Los datos geoquímicos publicados sobre la cantera se derivan de solamente ocho muestras que han sido analizadas por medio de métodos destructivos. Para definir mejor la variación geoquímica en la cantera, y para crear un método má sensible a la cultura hawaiana, empleamos la Fluorescencia de Rayos X para la Energía Dispersiva (EDXRF), no destructiva, de 820 lascas y 47 muestras geológicas de la cantera. Este estudio presenta la primera valoración sólida del alcance posible de la variabilidad geoquímica en la cantera. Los resultados sugieren que la EDXRF no destructiva se puede utilizar para diferenciar el basalto en Mauna Kea de otras canteras hawaianas, y también puede detectar la variación geoquímica desde dentro de la misma cantera.},

In addition to use-wear and residue analysis to identify its use, pXRF analysis conducted on it demonstrated that it was brought from the Admiralty Islands in Papua New Guinea over about 900\hspace{0.25em}km. The information on other Admiralty obsidian artefacts found in western Oceania and other associated phenomena suggest that those artefacts were brought from the source through an interaction network between Micronesia and Melanesia during the first half of the second millennium AD. They had significant social value as prestige goods in the peripheral areas of the Admiralty obsidian circulation, serving as chiefly heirlooms and grave goods. In addition to skilful Caroline Islands seafarers, Polynesian Outlier populations had an important role in the interregional interactions during this dynamic period in the western Pacific, which was possibly activated by Polynesian intrusion into the region related to a larger Polynesian expansion into eastern Polynesia circa AD\hspace{0.25em}1000. Further, we argue that the Saudeleur dynasty of Pohnpei, which achieved the development of a famous megalithic politico-religious centre, Nan Madol, was influential in the interaction sphere during its height in AD\hspace{0.25em}1000–1500. Thus, by using archaeological, linguistic, historical, ethnological, oral traditional and DNA data, the interdisciplinary analysis of this rare obsidian artefact has deepened our understanding of post-settlement interaction in the region.},

  abstract = {The Archaeobotany of East Timor’s early subsistence practices has not previously been the  target of systematic and comprehensive research, and this is the main purpose of this doctoral  thesis. The project aims at investigating early plant food management and the introduction of  agriculture in East Timor, using charred plant remains from archaeological sites as a direct line  of evidence.  East Timor’s economy today relies mostly on subsistence farming practices, involving a  diversified array of food products from different origins. Amongst the most widely distributed,  maize (Zea mays) and cassava (Manihot esculenta), originated in the American tropics and are  known to have been introduced after the XVI century, with the first European (Portuguese)  colonial contacts. Rice (Oryza sativa) was most probably domesticated in eastern Asia, and is  believed to have been introduced to Timor some time within the last 4000 years. Many fruits  and nuts (such as Canarium sp., Artocarpus spp., the breadfruit, and Pandanus sp.), as well as  different members of the Dioscoreaceae and Araceae families (Dioscorea alata and D. hispida  yams, and taro, Colocasia esculenta), are also widely used and may have been so since the  early‐ or the mid‐Holocene.  The history of plant management and agricultural origins in the wider region has been mostly  investigated through more indirect proxies, such as animal domesticates, pottery and pollen  records. In East Timor, the first pottery and animal domesticates appear in the archaeological  record around 3800‐3600 BP and are generally accepted as being associated with the  introduction of full agricultural practices. However, with the exception of Ian Glover’s seminal  work in the 1960s, very few plant remains from archaeological sites have ever been reported.  The main corpus of this project is based on the recovery, identification, and interpretation of  macrobotanical plant remains recovered during two archaeological fieldwork seasons, carried  out by the author in East Timor in 2004 and 2005. Macrobotanical assemblages derived from  excavations by Sue O’Connor, Matthew Spriggs and Peter Veth and not previously analysed,  are also incorporated in the study, and plant remains reported by Glover reassessed. With one  exception – which does not contradict the general picture – results obtained confirm the  absence of rice or millets in any of the excavated assemblages, suggesting that none of these  crops were introduced to East Timor with the first pottery or animal domesticates. They have  arrived only in a later period, possibly within the last 2000‐1500 years, when the caves  iv  investigated were no longer being systematically used for habitation purposes. The  macrobotanical analysis undertaken also suggests that a range of fruits and tubers have been  in use in Timor since the early‐ to mid‐Holocene, and that plant exploitation probably goes  back as far as ca. 40 ky before present.  The method of recovery of plant remains used in the field, based on comprehensive flotation  and wet‐sieving techniques, shows that it is indeed possible to unearth macrobotanical  assemblages from tropical and semi‐tropical archaeological environments. Systematic  comparison between archaeological specimens and a modern reference collection, based on  morphological and anatomical binomial attributes and the use of both light‐powered bifocal  and scanning electron microscopes, allows for positive identification of charred plant remains.  The adoption of these techniques by archaeologists needs to become standard research  practice across the region if we are to successfully address issues of past plant management  and agricultural origins.},

Site 50–10–19–30173 is a beach sand deposit with volcanic glass and other traditional Hawaiian artifacts that was sealed by an AD 1800–1801 lava flow. The proportion of Pu'uwa'awa'a volcanic glass in the assemblage is consistent with a cost surface model proposed recently. It is shown that the fall off in Pu'uwa'awa'a volcanic glass is exponential for the cost surface for Hawai'i Island, as it is for two alternative distance decay models, which also yield good fits to the volcanic glass data. A straight line distance overland model provides an easy way to generate predictions. A depot model, where Pu'uwa'awa'a volcanic glass is brought to Kahuwai Bay at Ka'ūpūlehu and distributed by canoe, fits the existing data somewhat better than the two overland transport models. It has been argued on the basis of distributional data and technological analyses that Pu'uwa'awa'a volcanic glass was a common pooled resource. The analysis presented here supports this idea by noting the lack of evidence for directional trade in the residuals of the fit to the exponential curve. Recommendations for future research are offered.},

The building of architectural structures and the cultural structuring of space can also be seen as political negotiation, even though the ideal spatial distribution is never met. While shared general patterns of spatial orientation may be identified across wide regions, it is also important to understand the development of spatial logic in the archaeological record as active processes embedded within historical context.},

  abstract = {The availability of lidar datasets has led to several advances in archaeology, notably in the process of site prospection. Some remote sensing practitioners have aimed to create automated feature extraction (AFE) techniques that increase the efficiency and efficacy of identification and analysis. While these advances have been successful, many archaeological professionals who might have an interest in lidar-derived products do not have the technical experience to modify or create AFE techniques for particular regions or environments. Additionally, some features are not appropriate for AFE. Instead, the most widely used technique is still likely to be visually based manual feature identification. Using authors of different experience levels, we seek to evaluate the use of manual techniques for feature identification and subsequent analysis by implementing a publicly available lidar-derived digital elevation model (DEM). We demonstrate that manual feature extraction (MFE) can be accurate when more than one researcher is involved in a sort of “checks and balances” process. We also show that the use of confidence ratings can be an important part of this process if those ratings have some systematic and clearly defined underpinning. Finally, we argue, using a case study from American Samoa, that manually identified features can be analytically important as part of larger landscape studies., La disponibilidad de conjuntos de datos lídar ha permitido varios avances en arqueología, notablemente en el proceso de prospección de sitios. Algunos profesionales de teledetección han apuntado a crear técnicas de extracción de características automatizadas (AFE por sus siglas en inglés) que aumentan la eficiencia y eficacia de la identificación y análisis. Aun cuando estos avances han sido exitosos, muchos arqueólogos interesados en el conjunto de datos lídar no tienen la experiencia técnica para modificar o crear técnicas AFE para su uso en regiones o ambientes particulares. Adicionalmente, algunos rasgos podrían no ser apropiados para el uso de AFE. Por lo tanto, es probable que la técnica mayormente usada continúe siendo la identificación manual de características por medio visual. Usando tres autores con diferentes niveles de experiencia, buscamos evaluar el uso de técnicas manuales para la identificación de rasgos y análisis subsecuentes usando un modelo de elevación digital de acceso público derivado de datos lídar. Demostramos que la extracción manual de características (MFE por sus siglas en inglés) puede ser precisa cuando más de un investigador participa en una especie de sistema de controles y balances. Demostramos que el uso de índices de confianza puede ser una parte importante de este proceso si las clasificaciones tienen bases claramente definidas y sistemáticas. Finalmente, usando el estudio de un caso de Samoa Estadounidense, argumentamos que la identificación manual de características puede ser analíticamente importante como parte de estudios de paisaje más amplios.},

  abstract = {Exchange plays a number of roles within societies, including the provisioning of necessary and prestige resources. The elucidation of these different roles requires documenting how different kinds of material were used and how these resources became distributed. These studies are particularly prominent in Polynesia, especially the Sāmoan archipelago. However, the nature and scale of artifact transfer within and outside the archipelago are debated given deficiencies in the empirical record. Here, we remedy this situation by examining trends in Sāmoan intra-archipelago exchange using geochemical and limited technological analyses of a lithic assemblage from the Manu‘a group of the Sāmoan archipelago. Our results indicate that material from multiple basalt sources is present, including several sources outside the Manu‘a group. It is apparent that this nonlocal material was used differently than local material as 95\% of analyzed adzes were manufactured of the former. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this nonlocal material was differentially distributed or controlled at the scale of the group or site. We argue that this is evidence of decentralized exchange and that imported materials became common pool resources to support community resiliency and sustainability.},

  abstract = {PIXE–PIGME analysis of 19 obsidian artefacts from Lakeba Island in east Fiji identified contact with northern Vanuatu in the post-colonization period (c. 2500–1000 bp) of Fiji. The Lakeba obsidian is the only physical evidence for interaction across the 850 km water gap separating the archipelagos of Vanuatu and Fiji in the first millennium ad. New research on the Vanuatu obsidian sources with laser ablation – inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) casts serious doubt on the validity of a long-distance inter-archipelago connection in the post-Lapita era. This paper presents the re-analysis of 18 obsidian artefacts from Lakeba using LA–ICP–MS and radiogenic isotope results that demonstrate that the Lakeba obsidian is not from Vanuatu, and it most likely derives from the Fiji–Tonga region. Geochemical evidence for long-distance interaction and migration between the West and Central Pacific in the post-Lapita era has yet to be identified.},

In later phases of Polynesian prehistory, stone adzes are important status goods which show substantial spatial and temporal variation. However, there is a debate when standardisation of form and manufacture appeared, whether it can be seen in earliest populations colonising the Pacific or whether it is a later development. We present in this paper a stone adze and obsidian tool assemblage from an early Ancestral Polynesian Society Talasiu site on Tongatapu, Kingdom of Tonga. The site shows a wide variety of adze types; however, if raw material origin is taken into account, emerging standardisation in adze form might be detected. We also show that Tongatapu was strongly connected in a network of interaction to islands to the North, particularly Samoa, suggesting that these islands had permanent populations.},

Although it has been proposed that additional Lapita settlements may have been distributed along the coasts of much of the archipelago, investigations have not located these deposits nor reliably dated early Polynesian Plainware deposits older than ∼2500 cal BP. We combine a chronometric hygiene protocol and a GIS-based model of the paleoshoreline to examine the temporal and spatial distribution of pre-2000 cal BP archaeological deposits in the islands. Using the currently available suite of radiocarbon dates, it is apparent that only by ∼2300–2000 cal BP were a number of settlements occupied across the archipelago. Acknowledging that a variety of geomorphological processes have changed the Sāmoan landscape, we developed a GIS-based model of the ∼3000 cal BP coastlines of Tutuila and Aunu’u Islands, which suggest that suitable sandy coastal flats had not formed in many areas prior to ∼2500 cal BP, hence limiting settlement by Lapita peoples. Our methodology, which combines an evaluation of early radiocarbon dates with a GIS-based paleoshoreline model, offers a valuable means of incorporating temporal and spatial data for the examination of coastal and island colonization.},

  abstract = {In this thesis we develop an approach to using obsidian hydration date (OHD) chronometric data as a chronology building tool. A Bayesian interpretive framework is developed that enables archaeological chronology to be outlined through OHD data. This is implemented both for OHD as a stand-alone dating system, and for OHD in combination with convention radiocarbon age (CRA) chronometric measurements. On the basis of this development we assess the current utility of OHD as a chronology building tool, and evaluate its future potential. The purpose of this research is two-fold.  At a general level the research presented here illustrates how the Bayesian calibration frameworks that have been extensively developed over the past decade (e.g., Naylor and Smith 1988; Buck and Litton 1995; Buck et al. 1991, 1992, 1994a, 1994b, 1994c, 1996; Christen 1994a, 1994b; Christen and Buck 1998; Christen and Litton 1995; Christen et al. 1995; Litton and Buck 1995, 1996; Litton and Leese 1991; Nicholls and Jones 1998, 2001; Zeidler et al.l998) can be extended to incorporate other types of chronometric data - OHD in this case. To-date the implementation of Bayesian calibration frameworks have principally focussed on combining CRA data with non-metric temporal data such as the relative ordering of events implied by super-position. However, while radiocarbon is the most widely used chronometric technique in the world other types of chronometric data are more suited to addressing particular temporal questions than radiocarbon assays. In the example considered in this thesis we identify obsidian hydration dating as having the potential to provide chronometric data that can address questions relating to the fine grained relative timing of events, which is identified as a particular weakness of the radiocarbon chronometric largely due to the non-monotonic nature of the radiocarbon calibration curve.  At a New Zealand specific level the research presented in this thesis seeks to provide an advance in the ability to resolve the type of temporal questions that are central to the understanding of New Zealand's archaeological record. By world standards New Zealand's prehistory is short- potentially spanning only 600 years. Thus the temporal resolution of archaeological investigation is typically high. In this thesis we seek to combine radiocarbon and OHD chronometric data within a suitable statistical framework that leverages the benefits of both techniques, enhancing our ability to explore archaeological chronology in New Zealand.  Thus the research presented in this thesis outlines the development of an approach to chronometric enquiry that is of general interest and in the process make an advance for archaeological enquiry in New Zealand.},

  abstract = {The peopling of the Western Pacific south of the Solomon Islands started with the spread of Austronesian populations more than 3000 years ago. The initial colonization of Remote Oceania is archaeologically linked to the Lapita Cultural Complex, identified at more than 100 major sites from Island Papua-New Guinea to Western Polynesia by a distinctive type of dentate-stamped decorated pottery and associated items. Until the last decade, Lapita sites of New Caledonia, the southernmost archipelago of Melanesia, had been poorly studied, leading to unsatisfactory conclusions about the characteristics and the length of the founding cultural complex. New excavations undertaken at the most southerly Lapita site of the Pacific, the St Maurice-Vatcha site on the Isle of Pines, shed new light on the matter. Although one of the first Lapita sites identified in the region and excavated by different teams over the years, its stratigraphy, chronology, and artifacts were not well understood. The new excavations have led to a precise understanding of the stratigraphy, and a large set of new 14C dates have firmly established Lapita chronology. The study of the archaeological material helps to test the proposal of a "Southern Lapita Province," characterizing the earliest sites of southern Melanesia.}

  abstract = {Obsidian in New Zealand was exploited from a variety of sources, and has been found in the majority of New Zealand archaeological sites. The presence of obsidian from the Mayor Island sources in most sites has been noted by archaeologists, and it has been assumed that a complex exchange system was responsible for its distribution. The purpose of the present thesis has been to evaluate the importance of Mayor Island as the· main supply source of obsidian in prehistoric New Zealand, and to study the pattern of exploitation and distribution of the obsidian.    The analysis employed two separate approaches: site-oriented and regional. On a site-oriented basis, the quarries on Mayor Island were examined, particularly the production and procurement strategies. Ethnographic and comparable archaeological data on quarry exploitation were reviewed in order to test for evidence of access restrictions to the resources.    For the regional analysis, archaeological obsidian assemblages from 58 sites were sourced using energy dispersive XRF spectroscopy. Sourcing results indicate a changing pattern of source utilization throughout the temporal depth of New Zealand prehistory. The pattern of source utilization also varied according to site function.    The regional analysis of Mayor Island obsidian investigated further the importance of the Mayor Island obsidian in in the total  lithic  assemblages of the sites studied, and the nature of· the manufacturing techniques in relation to geographical distance from the source, by means of fall-off curves.    Using this combined methodological approach it was possible to conclude that the exploitation of Mayor Island obsidian varied between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. While direct access seems to be the most probable way of acquiring the raw materials in the North Island, down-the-line exchange seems to be indicated for the South Island.},

The analysis demonstrates the capabilities of portable XRF and confirms the previous analysis of this material by combined density and PIXE-PIGME techniques. Our conclusions also indicate the importance of the Bao source region at Talasea and support the earlier suggestion that during the Lapita period an important passage crossed the Willaumez Peninsula in the vicinity of the Talasea airstrip and the Bao sources.},

In northern New Guinea, the Maluku Islands, and the Philippines, shell adzes appear during this period alongside contact between islands. In this paper we present new data from the site of Asitau Kuru, Timor-Leste, to show that the creation of shell adzes and greater inter-island connectivity also characterizes the early and middle and early Holocene in the Nusa Tenggara archipelago of southern Wallacea. We suggest that one of the functions of these shell adzes was in making dugout canoes enabling regular access to neighboring islands; the import of exotic stone materials; long-term occupation of very small islands; and, with new hook and line technology, the capture of more fish. This evidence predates the Neolithic in the region and corroborates a linguistic hypothesis that there was a pre-Austronesian interaction sphere covering much of Wallacea.},

Yet, little investigation has been dedicated to basalt resources, artifacts, and their geochemistry. As part of the Rapa Nui Geochemical Project (2014–2017), we conducted comprehensive fieldwork, material culture and archaeometric analyses focused on Easter Island's archaeological basalt industries. Our results highlight how the prehistoric Rapanui were sophisticated Polynesian stone workers who developed multiple tool reduction sequences for several types of basaltic material, creating unique anthropogenic landscapes in the process. Using laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) of geological source material from 31 quarries and 61 artifacts from the Sebastián Englert Anthropology Museum, we argue that similar to other culturally valuable stone (i.e. obsidian, scoria, and tuff), there was communal access to and use of Rapa Nui's basalt resources. In turn, prehistoric communal access to stone hints at patterns of sociopolitical and economic interaction, including cultural connectivity on this eastern Polynesian outpost. Thus, our empirically derived archaeological conclusion casts doubt on sociopolitical and economic interpretations proposed by Easter Island's collapse narrative.},

These geological and archaeological sites provided the raw materials for tools such as toki (adzes and picks), which facilitated the manufacture of Easter Island’s iconic stonework. Other basaltic tools such as hoe (knives), ohio (axes) and mangai ma¯‘ea (stone fishhooks) served for subsistence practices. However, little is known about the sources of these artefacts, the sequence of their manufacture and their geochemical compositions.

Coastal changes caused by tectonic activity and other natural events during the late Holocene, together with human activities, have severely affected many localities. The main pottery sequence is bracketed by the W-K2 and W-K3 tephras. It probably began c. 3370–3140 cal. bp and ended during the period c. 2350–1850 cal. bp. Most pottery was locally produced, though several exotic sherds indicate links with the south coast of New Br…itain. Early sites are located on islands as well as the mainland. Boduna Island might have been used for special, perhaps ritual, activities. After the W-K3 tephra, pottery was not used again in the Talasea area until the last few hundred years, when trade wares were imported from the New Guinea mainland.},

These results are the background for the first region-wide research project focussing on obsidian characterisation and its role in prehistoric inter-island exchange. It is commonly held that distribution of obsidian in ISEA was only localised and inter-island transportation limited. The review, however, suggests that this hypothesis derives from an incomplete knowledge of obsidian distribution in the region rather than typifying prehistoric social patterns. Obsidian sourcing has been carried out only intermittently in ISEA since the 1970s and has generally been focussed only at the single site level, thus explaining this very partial understanding.},

In order to document the nature of quarry exploitation and obsidian distribution, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence was used to characterize the elemental composition of each source. The classification of 331 archaeological samples from inland habitation sites, ritual centers, and crematoria by discriminant analysis revealed selective patterns of obsidian usage. Obsidian from Rano Kau II was rarely used while Maunga Orito and Rano Kau I glasses were present in nearly equal proportions at inland domestic habitation sites. Motu Iti obsidian was a rare occurrence at interior locations but more frequent at coastally located ritual centers, crematoria, and caves. Surface architecture in the form of an elite house at Maunga Orito, restricted source usage, and the sacred nature of the offshore islets, suggested an elite managerial presence at two quarries in the distribution of obsidian to the island population during prehistory.},

Population growth and expansion, elaboration of the agricultural system, and the development of socio-political complexity provide a series of problems of recent concern in Hawaiian archaeology. Within this framework archaeological research focusing on prehistoric agricultural change was conducted for three seasons in windward valleys of the NW section of the Island of Hawai'i. A summary of the evidence regarding agricultural change in two of these valleys is presented in this paper.},

If true, this is further documentation of post-colonisation contact between West and East Polynesia, regions which were generally throught to have remined isolated from one another following human settlement. The results of geochemical analysis and thin section petrography indicate a very high probability that the adzes are Samoan with a close match to the islands of Manu'a. This provides a close correspondence with Rarotongan oral tradition. These sourcing results are discussed along with those available for adzes from other sites in the Southern Cooks. This evidence demonstrates significant interaction with West Polynesia during the early phase of Southern Cooks prehistory.},

By A.C. 1000, most inhabitable islands were occupied and inter-island voyaging was a vital link sustaining small populations on ecologically-marginal landfalls—islands that pushed the capabilities of Polynesian colonization to their limits. Several islands throughout Polynesia evidence prehistoric occupation yet were not inhabited at European contact. Henderson Island, SE Polynesia, with its extreme environmental conditions, typifies such so-called “mystery islands.” The results of a recent multidisciplinary study are summarized, which include an island-wide survey, test excavations, and the recovery of the largest artifact, faunal, and floral assemblages from this part of Polynesia. These data provide new evidence for ascertaining the role of inter-island voyaging in sustaining isolated populations, and how human colonists altered insular landscapes and caused faunal extinctions. It is argued that Henderson Island prehistory is most profitably examined within the context of regional dynamics.},

  abstract = {The prehistoric settlement of the Pacific Ocean has intrigued scholars and stimulated anthropological debate for the past two centuries. Colonized over a few millennia during the mid to late Holocene, the islands of the Pacific–displaying a wide diversity of geological and biotic variability–provided the stage for endless "natural experiments" in human adaptation. Crucial to understanding the evolution and transformation of island societies is documenting the relative degree of interisland contacts after island colonization. In the western Pacific, ideal materials for archaeologically documenting interisland contact–obsidian, pottery, and shell ornaments–are absent or of limited geographic distribution in Polynesia. Consequently, archaeologists have relied increasingly on fine-grained basalt artifacts as a means for documenting colonization routes and subsequent interisland contacts. Routinely used x-ray fluorescence characterization of oceanic island basalt has some problems for discriminating source rocks and artifacts in provenance studies. The variation in trace and major element abundances is largely controlled by near-surface magma-chamber processes and is broadly similar between most oceanic islands. We demonstrate that Pb isotope analysis accurately discriminates rock source and is an excellent technique for charting the scale, frequency, and temporal span of imported fine-grained basalt artifacts found throughout Polynesia. The technique adds another tool for addressing evolutionary models of interaction, isolation, and cultural divergence in the eastern Pacific.},

Here we report the application of nondestructive energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis to the sourcing of Polynesian artifacts made from basalt, one of the most ubiquitous materials in Polynesian archaeological sites. We have compared excavated and surface-collected basalt adzes and adze flakes from two sites in Samoa (site AS-13-1) and the Cook Islands (site MAN-44), with source basalts from known prehistoric quarries in these archipelagoes. In both cases, we are able to demonstrate the importing of basalt adzes from Tutuila Island, a distance of 100 km to Ofu Island, and of 1600 km to Mangaia Island. These findings are of considerable significance for Polynesian prehistory, as they demonstrate the movement of objects not only between islands in the same group (where communities were culturally and linguistically related) but also between distant island groups. Further applications of EDXRF analysis should greatly aid archaeologists in their efforts to reconstruct ancient trade and exchange networks, not only in Polynesia but also in other regions where basalt was a major material for artifact production.},

Although major adze quarries are known from most Polynesian archipelagos, a geologically informed archaeological survey was designed for discovering the variability in stone-tool-quality rock sources. Thirteen quarries and sources within the ∼20,000 hectare traditional land unit of Kaluako‘i (literally, the adze pit) on Moloka‘i, Hawaiian Islands, vary considerably in size, production output and settlement context, suggesting that individual adze quarries were accorded different roles across the social landscape. Some sixty-four radiocarbon age determinations and U-series dates from quarries and habitation sites with artefacts originating from quarries, document the temporal sequence of use beginning in the Late Expansion Period (ad 1400–1650), at least two centuries after settlement of the island. Further studies will report on adze technology and on-going geochemical sourcing analyses.},

We defined the approximate limits of the quarry complex, located the in situ geological source of the fine-grained basalt used for adze manufacture, report the petrographic and geochemical variability of the source rock, and describe the adze reduction strategies from analysis of adze blanks andpreforms, as well as hammerstones and debitage. The geochemical variation of the nine source rocks and artefacts were defined by a comprehensive array of 10 fully quantitative major element concentrations, 43 trace element abundances, and high-precision Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios obtained using the state-of-the-art Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS, for Sr isotopes), Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS, for Nd-Pb isotopes), quadrupole ICP-MS (for trace elements) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES, for major elements), respectively. A piece of branch coral was recovered from the surface of a rockshelter that provided a U-series date of possible quarry use in the mid-13th century.

  abstract = {According to studies in the early 1990s, quarry/habitation site (MO-B6-161) on leeward Moloka‘i may have been occupied about a century earlier than regional settlement models imply. In the first instance, we dated nut shell fragments from the Polynesian introduced candlenut (kukui, Aleurites moluccana), from the original radiocarbon sample collection curated at the Bishop Museum, producing a calibrated age (at 2 σ) of AD 690-895 (Beta-336756). Our renewed excavations obtained appropriate short-lived twig wood for dating in addition to another date on candlenut. Four dates produced a calibrated median age of AD 1770, more in line with expectations for late prehistoric settlement in these marginal leeward regions. However, the oldest date was not contaminated with old carbon and satisfies all aspects of ‘chronometric hygiene’. Because of this unusually early date (especially on a Polynesian introduced plant), we report in detail its leeward site context, additional dates, depositional context, stratigraphic sequence and the cultural inventory of the MO-B6-161 site as well as the details of sample pretreatment and discuss the absence of sources of carbon contamination. High-quality geochemistry of adze source rock is also presented, thus facilitating island and archipelago-wide interaction studies.},

  abstract = {Polynesian adze sourcing studies that rely on geochemical analyses to assign distant artefacts to a source or quarry have been undertaken for more than three decades. Understanding intra-source geochemical variability is essential for robust artefact source assignments, yet these data are not available for most quarries. We provide a seven-step protocol for sampling source rocks and associated artefacts at quarries and, using the large Eiao quarry (Marquesas Islands) as a case study, demonstrate the efficacy of the protocol. A "sampling to redundancy" statistical procedure documents that ∼7-11 samples are required to capture the variability of 10 oxides, 49 trace elements and seven isotope ratios. We advocate using the broadest array of fully quantitative geochemical values to characterise quarries and sources that will facilitate current and future sourcing studies. In the biological sense, this is analogous to the formal description of a holotype. Quarry samples should also be collected and curated to enable research when new protocols are established and more precise and accurate geochemical techniques develop.},

  abstract = {The Cook Islands are considered the “gateway” for human colonization of East Polynesia, the final chapter of Oceanic settlement and the last major region occupied on Earth. Indeed, East Polynesia witnessed the culmination of the greatest maritime migration in human history. Perennial debates have critiqued whether Oceanic settlement was purposeful or accidental, the timing and pathways of colonization, and the nature and extent of postcolonization voyaging—essential for small founding groups securing a lifeline between parent and daughter communities. Centering on the well-dated Tangatatau rockshelter, Mangaia, Southern Cook Islands, we charted the temporal duration and geographic spread of exotic stone adze materials—essential woodworking tools found throughout Polynesia— imported for more than 300 y beginning in the early AD 1300s. Using a technique requiring only 200 mg of sample for the geochemical analysis of trace elements and isotopes of fine-grained basalt adzes, we assigned all artifacts to an island or archipelago of origin. Adze material was identified from the chiefly complex on the Austral Islands, from the major adze quarry complex on Tutuila (Samoa), and from the Marquesas Islands more than 2,400 km distant. This interaction is the only dated example of down-the-line exchange in central East Polynesia where intermediate groups transferred commodities attesting to the interconnectedness and complexity of social relations fostered during postsettlement voyaging. For the Cook Islands, this exchange may have lasted into the 1600s, at least a century later than other East Polynesian archipelagos, suggesting that interarchipelago interaction contributed to the later development of social hierarchies.},
